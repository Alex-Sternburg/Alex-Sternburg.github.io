# Background
My workflow began with me finding all the material I wanted to include on the site
I also chose a template from the above website to use as a base for my website
Another thing I did was upload portions of performances onto youtube, creating thumbnails and getting the embed link.
I also used postimages to get urls for images I wanted to use.
Also a lot of working on the project was me playing around with different code I learned from w3schools.

# Hidden Sidebar (reveals when clicked on menu icon)
This section was made by the template. However I ran into an issue of the bar not working at one point during my workflow. I was able to fix it by using the developer tool on the demo and comparing it against my html. Once I did this I located where the missing part was and added it back in. I also played around with what the tags would be.

## Page Content
I had some difficulty with getting the image onto the webpage. I figured out that I needed to upload it on the web so that I could get an appropriate jpeg file url. I  


# Header
The most difficult aspect of this section was linking the button to a downloadable resume that can be viewed in a different tab. After using iframe, which didn't work I tried wrapping <a> href with the button, however this again didn't work. With effort after effort I was able to get it to work by wrapping the button with the <a></a>(opposite to what I tried prior)

# Portfolio Section
This was another challenge. I used the template as a base for this section but I had a hard time with the papers. Originally I had the papers on the website with the ability to scroll on site. This didn't look great. So I then changed it to images that I wrapped in the <a></a> like I did with the button. Again these images were uploaded on post images to get the source url. For the Youtube links, I uploaded my cropped videos to the site and got the embed link for those and added them to the website. To clean up this section I added borders(something i learned again from w3schools). I do however have to add bootstraps specifically in this section to allow for better mobile use. Users in the section have the ability to open and view my work and performances.

# About Section
This section was easier to make as the template had a set paragraph that I just altered to showcase me.
I used the bar graphs to represent my skill level for those particular aspects.
I again transformed the bar with client, performances, negotiation and partners(This was again my attempt at using the template to better suite my needs)
# Testimonials
I reached out to three people that could talk about me as a student and as a person. I am still waiting for one response. I did take out the avatar image because I didn't ask permission from the people I asked to include a photo of them,, so it would've been unfair and unprofessional to do so.

# Grid for Achievments tables
On the originally template this was a pricing grid, so I tried to alter it to work for my site. Therefore, I thought it would be the perfect place to highlight my achievements (activities and honors)


# Contact Section
It was easy enough to add my location, phone number and email.

# Footer
This is where I had to link my socials. By using the skills I learned earlier in the code, I was able to easily link to the images on the site.

#Reflection/Improvements
All of the answers I was looking for was on the w3schools, however most of this project was me spending hours trying one thing and then another. In other words I was playing around with a lot of the more difficult aspects such as getting an image uploaded, having my resume downloadable from the button, and linking the images of my essays to my actual papers for reading. For the most part though as I solved one issue I was able to implement the answer to my problem to other aspects of the site. In particular linking things properly. I also had to do a lot of reworking the formatting and dimensions of all my media.

I think that as far as improvements I need to have a border between the side image and the website material. I should also bootstrap my website as well for better mobile use and I should also clean it up and make it look less like a beginner programmer made it.
