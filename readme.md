# Background
My workflow began with me finding all the material I wanted to include on the site
I also chose a template from the above website to use as a base for my website
Another thing I did was upload portions of performances onto youtube, creating thumbnails and getting the embed link.
I also used postimages to get urls for images I wanted to use.
Also a lot of working on the project was me playing around with different code I learned from w3schools.
